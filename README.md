# Project Akita

Project Akita is designed as the next-generation computer architecture
simulator framework.

This repository implements the simulator core that can be
shared by multiple simulators. We try to avoid introducing computer architecture
specific concepts (e.g., os, driver) into this repository to allowing for
using the simulator core in any other discrete simulation field.

The core part of Project Akita consists of 4 parts, the event-driven simulation
engine, the component system, the request-connection system, and the hook
system.
